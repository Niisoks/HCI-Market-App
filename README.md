# Required tools
The required tools you'll need to compile and edit this project are as follows:
- A Windows(pc), Linux(pc) or Mac(pc-hackintosh/mac).
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install)
- Some kind of java development kit (JDK)

# Contributing
In order to contribute, please open a new branch prior to creating changes. The changes you make should be submitted into a pull-request, this pull-request will be reviewed and merged by a dedicated Maintainer. Submitting a PR and merging it without first going through a maintainer will cause your access rights to be removed.

Ideally, all pull requests should have a corresponding issue. Issues should follow a recognisable template, but it is not strictly required. In addition to this, it is highly recommended that you use the project board to organise your results prior to releases.


# Standards
Please try and follow any kind of recognised architecture. Philip Lackner on youtube is a very good resource for those of you who are just beginning with android development. Unreadable code, disorganised code, and code that does not run will result in a closed PR.

# Plagiarism
Any code that is obviously copy-pasted garbage that you, nor we, can understand will result in a closed PR. Multiple pull-request submissions containing blatant plagiarism will result in your access rights being removed.

# General toolset
- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Android room
- Version Catalogue for dependencies
- Material 3 for theming

# Scope
Do not go out of scope unless we have significant time. We must ensure that the application functions as it's supposed to. While it would be great to have a working backend, this is currently out of scope for a hi-fi prototype - instead we should look to just load directly from JSON and then store it inside of the Room to mimic an api request.

# Testing
While Unit Tests are not required, they are highly recommended for the future of the project, but as the deadline for this project is soon approaching it makes sense that some of you will not know how to create unit tests and will need to spend some time learning this - which could cause delays we will be unable to deal with.

Testing should be done with whatever tool is currently available in the project, introducing new tools for your unit tests without the appropriate explanation could result in a closed PR.
